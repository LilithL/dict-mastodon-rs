# dict-mastodon-rs

## Installation

There aren't any release (yet), tho you can clone the project and compile it with `cargo build`.

## Usage

You can have a detailed list of possible options by typing `masto_bot --help`, `masto_bot help` or simply `masto_bot`.

## Dictionaries

You can either write full sentences by starting the line with `**` like : `**I'm feelings good today` or simply type a word per line.

## Features

Here are the current feature ~~and upcoming ones~~. This is going to change with time ofc:

- CLI interface with different commands
- Reading config files and parsing them
- Reading the dictionary
- ~~Selecting a random sentence in the dictionary and adding a custom word~~
- ~~Register to a mastodon instance and saving the tokens into the config file~~
- ~~Login on a registered account~~
- ~~Post a generated sentence~~
- ~~Post indefinitelly with a custom delay~~
